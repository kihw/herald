## 🏗️ Architecture Transformation

### **Before (Python-based)**
```
Frontend → Go API → Analytics Service → Python Subprocess → Database
                                    ↓
                              JSON Serialization
                              Process Management
                              Sequential Processing
                              Memory Overhead
```

### **After (Go Native Optimized)**
```
Frontend → Go API → Optimized Analytics Service ┬→ Redis Cache (TTL-based)
                                               ├→ Worker Pool (Goroutines) 
                                               ├→ Go Native Services
                                               └→ Database (Direct connection)
                   ↓
            Performance Monitoring & Health Checks
```
